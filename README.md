# Database_data_sort
Sorting continuous data stream by id.

On input you write the name of the file with data and the program will input it in the database. After that it will ask you for another file to insert.
After that the program will insert data in to the database in a way that it will be sorted by match_id. You can keep naming files and program will insert them 
in to the database (the database is sorted by match_id at all times). When you have imported all your files you can type "stop".
